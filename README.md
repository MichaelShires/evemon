# **EVEMon** 

This is my fork of the [https://github.com/peterhaneve/evemon](Evemon) program. My goal is to port the business logic over to .NET MAUI, to allow for a modern, sleeker, cross platform app that anyone can use. I've very new to MAUI so let me know if you have any questions or want to help!
